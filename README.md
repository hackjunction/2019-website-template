# Junction website template

This is a template project which serves as a starting point for building your JunctionX website. It is a trimmed-down version of the Junction 2019 website at https://2019.hackjunction.com

This template includes a React.js frontend as well as a CMS built on Strapi. Most content on the website is editable via the CMS, and the React frontend provides a good level of customisability should you need it.
